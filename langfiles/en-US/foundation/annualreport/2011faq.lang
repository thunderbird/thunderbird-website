;How do you measure success?
How do you measure success?


;At Mozilla, we measure success by how much we are doing to improve the overall health of the Web and advance the interests of users and developers. We succeed when we build products that people love, and when other organizations build build the traits and features we care about into competing products. For example, we view Google Chrome's recent implementation of the Do Not Track feature we pioneered to be a success for Mozilla and our mission.
