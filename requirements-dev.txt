# This file is the base requirements for building. When you want to change any
# requirements, update this file and use
#
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# to test it. When you have the requirements how you like, run:
# 
#   pip-compile --generate-hashes -o requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
#
# to generate the hashed requirements file used by the production build.
#
# You should use python 2.7's pip-compile until we drop support for python
# 2.7, as python 3's pip-compile will freeze newer version numbers that
# aren't 2.7-compatible on some packages.
