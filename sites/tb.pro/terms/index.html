    <h2>4. User-Generated Content</h2>

    <h3>a. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h3>

    <p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Services. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Services, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>

    <h3>b. MZLA May Remove Content</h3>

    <p>We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or any of our terms or policies.</p>

    <h3>c. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</h3>

    <p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you share anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you share; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to share; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you share.</p>

    <p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Users of the Services — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections 4(d) - 4(f) below. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting us the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections 4(d) - 4(f).</p>

    <p>When you remove Your Content from our servers, we will continue to have a license so long as we have the right to retain Your Content as provided in Section 9(b) (“Upon Cancellation”), and only to the extent necessary to exercise our rights under that section. After that, the Content licenses you grant in this Section will end with respect to Content associated with your account. If you have shared Your Content with other users, then the licenses in this section shall persist so long as the Content resides on the Services.</p>

    <h3>d. Our License to Your Content</h3>

    <p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content and share it as directed by you, for example when you attach it to an email message or share it via Send. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, distribute, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Services, including improving the Services over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy Your Content to our database and make backups; display it to you and other users you share it with; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; and share it with other users at your direction.</p>

    <p>This license does not grant MZLA the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant MZLA the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service.</p>

    <h3>e. Moral Rights</h3>

    <p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, share, or submit to any part of the Services, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section 4(d), but not otherwise.</p>

    <p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant MZLA the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Services.</p>

    <h3>f. Feedback</h3>

    <p>We’re always trying to improve our products and Services, and your feedback will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or Services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that MZLA will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.</p>

    <p>You represent that your feedback is your original creation. If your feedback includes any third-party materials, you agree to include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of your feedback.</p>

    <h2>6. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h2>

There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.</p>

    <p>We will terminate the Accounts of Users who repeatedly use the Services to infringe copyright.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property Notice</h2>

    <h3>a. Our Rights to Our Content</h3>
