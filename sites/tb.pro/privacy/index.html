    <h2 id="page-header">MZLA Privacy Statement</h2>

    <p>Effective date: Februrary 10, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to the MZLA Privacy Statement, which applies to all MZLA websites and online services, including Thunderbird Pro Services. This is where we describe how we handle your “Personal Data,” which is information that is directly linked or can be linked to you. It applies to the Personal Data that MZLA Technologies Corporation and its affiliates (Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation) process as the “Data Controller” when you use our online services, interact with MZLA’s websites, or participate in events or activities such as user surveys and focus groups (collectively, the “Services”).</p>

    <h2>Personal Data We Collect</h2>

    <p>Depending on how you use the Services, we may collect Personal Data from you directly, automatically from your device, and/or from third parties. The Personal Data MZLA processes when you use the Services depends on variables like how you interact with our Services (such as through web interfaces, desktop or mobile applications), the Services you use (such as Thundermail, Send, or Appointment), and the features of each Service that you use. Below, we describe the categories of information we may collect through these channels depending upon how you use them:</p>

    <h3>From You</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thunderbird Account Data:</strong> We collect certain information when you open a Thunderbird account such as your handle, name, email address, password, payment information and transaction information.</li>
      <li><strong>User Content and Files:</strong> When you use our Services, we collect Personal Data included as part of the information you provide such as email messages, files, calendar and address book entries, inputs, text, documents, images, or feedback.</li>
      <li><strong>Demographic Information:</strong> In some cases, such as when you choose to participate in surveys or focus groups, you may optionally provide us with ethnicity, gender, or similar demographic details.</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback Data:</strong> This consists of information you submit through surveys, reviews, or interactive features.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> For paid subscriptions and financial contributions, we collect details like name, billing address, and transaction specifics. Payments are processed by a third-party processor and MZLA does not collect or store your payment card or account details.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> We collect information to enable you create a user profile for your Thunderbird account, which may include a photo, additional email addresses, job title, or biography.</li>
      <li><strong>Sales and Marketing Data:</strong> This includes information provided voluntarily by you for promotional communications, such as name, email address, and company name.</li>

    </ul>


    <h3>Automatically</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Buttons, Tools, and Content from Other Companies:</strong> Our website may contain links or buttons that lead to social media sites like Mastodon and Bluesky and other third-party services like FundraiseUp. Our Services may also contain links or buttons that lead to third-party services like Zoom that may be integrated with the Services. Use of these features may result in data collection. Engaging with these buttons, tools, or content may automatically send certain browser information to these companies. Please review the privacy statements of these companies for more information.</li>
      <li><strong>Essential Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies:</strong> We use cookies and similar technologies to provide essential functionality like storing settings and recognizing you while using our Services.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-essential Cookies:</strong> Depending on your jurisdiction, we may use online analytics products that use cookies to help us analyze how de-identified users use our Services and to enhance your experience when you use the Services. In some jurisdictions, we only use non-essential cookies after obtaining your consent. See this section for more details and control options.</li>
      <li><strong>Email Marketing Interactions:</strong> Our emails may have web beacons that offer information on your device type, email client, email reception, opens, and link clicks.</li>
      <li><strong>Geolocation Information:</strong> Depending on the Service&rsquo;s functionality, we collect regional geolocation data in order to improve our Services, such as by troubleshooting and improving email deliverability in certain areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Service Usage Information:</strong> We collect data about your interactions with the Services, such as IP address, device information, session details, date and time of requests, device type and ID, operating system and application version, and performance of specific features or Services.</li>

This can include details like your name and email from services like Zoom when it is integrated with Appointment. The information we receive depends on the third-party&rsquo;s settings and privacy policies. Always review these to understand what data is shared with our Services.</li>
      <li><strong>Vendors, Partners, and Affiliates:</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties, like vendors, resellers, partners, or affiliates for the purposes outlined in this statement.</li>

      <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> We use Personal Data to customize the Service to your preferences and to provide a tailored and consistent user experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Safety and Security:</strong> To promote safety, integrity, and security across our Services, we process Personal Data, using both automated and, at times, manual techniques for abuse detection, prevention, and violations of terms of service.</li>

      <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> We use Personal Data to identify and resolve technical issues.</li>

      <li><strong>Other Third-party Applications:</strong> Upon your instruction, we may share Personal Data with third-party service providers (such as Zoom, Google) when you integrate their services with ours. You are responsible for the data you instruct us to share with these applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Other Users and the Public:</strong> Depending on your Thunderbird account settings, we may share Personal Data with other users of the Services and the public (such as when you make a Send file or Appointment calendar publicly accessible).

    <p>Files shared using Send are end-to-end encrypted with keys accessible only to the account owner. MZLA cannot access the contents of a Send file unless you (or someone with whom you have shared the file) provides the key to us.</p>

    <h2>Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data (Applicable to EEA and UK End Users)</h2>

    <p>MZLA processes Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR, ensuring a lawful basis for each processing activity. The basis varies depending on the data type and the context, including how you access the services. Our processing activities typically fall under these lawful bases:</p>

      <li><strong>Legal Obligation:</strong> We process data when it&rsquo;s necessary to comply with applicable laws or to protect the rights, safety, and property of MZLA, our affiliates, users, or third parties.</li>

    <h2>International data transfers</h2>

    <p>MZLA stores and processes Personal Data in a variety of locations, including your local region, the United States, and other countries where MZLA, its affiliates, subsidiaries, or subprocessors have operations. We transfer Personal Data from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to countries that the European Commission has not recognized as having an adequate level of data protection. When we engage in such transfers, we generally rely on the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj">Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914</a>, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data.

    <h2>Our use of cookies and tracking technologies</h2>

    <h3>Cookies and tracking technologies</h3>

    <p>MZLA uses cookies to provide, secure and improve our Services or to develop new features and functionality of our Service. For example, we use them to (i) keep you logged in, (ii) remember your preferences, (iii) identify your device for security and fraud purposes, including as needed to maintain the integrity of our Service, (iv) compile statistical reports, and (v) provide information and insight for future development of MZLA products and services. We provide more information below about cookies on MZLA websites, including the cookies we set, the needs we have for those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.</p>

    <p>Our emails to users may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and in what region you are located. We use this pixel tag to make our email communications more effective and to make sure we are not sending you unwanted email.</p>

    <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browser or device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay until they expire or are deleted. The expiration time or retention period applicable to persistent cookies depends on the purpose of the cookie collection and tool used. You may be able to delete cookie data. For more information, see <a href="#what-are-your-cookie-choices-and-controls?">below</a>.</p>

    <h4>What are cookies and similar technologies?</h4>

    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies, such as local storage, and mobile analytics, to operate and provide our Services. Our marketing communications may also contain web beacons set by our vendors.</p>

    <p>Cookies are small text files stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.</p>

    <p>Web beacons are electronic images (also called “single-pixel” or “clear GIFs”) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content.</p>

    <h4>How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?</h4>

    <p>The MZLA Services use cookies and similar technologies for a variety of purposes, including to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our Services perform, track your interaction with the Services, develop inferences, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. Some of these cookies and technologies may be provided by third parties, including service providers. For example, our analytics partners may use these technologies in our Services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) related to your online activities over time and across Services for various purposes. MZLA may place non-essential cookies on pages where we market products and services to customers.</p>

    <p>We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.</p>

    <p>The table below provides additional information about how we use different types of cookies:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align:left;"> Purpose </th>
          <th> Description </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align:left;"> Required Cookies </td>
          <td> MZLA uses required cookies to perform essential website functions and to provide the services. For example, cookies are used to log you in, save your language preferences, improve performance, route traffic between web servers, detect the size of your screen, determine page load times, improve user experience, and for audience measurement. These cookies are necessary for our websites to work. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align:left;"> Analytics </td>
          <td> We allow third parties to use analytics cookies to understand how visitors use our websites so we can make them better. For example, cookies are used to gather information about the pages our users visit most often and how many clicks it takes for a user to accomplish a task.  </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>


    <h4>What are your cookie choices and controls?</h4>

    <p>You can control the cookies you encounter on the web using a variety of widely-available tools. For example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If your browser sends a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">Do Not Track</a> (DNT) signal, MZLA will not set non-essential cookies and will not load third party resources which set non-essential cookies.</li>
      <li>Many browsers provide cookie controls which may limit the types of cookies you encounter online. Check out the documentation for your browser to learn more.</li>
      <li>If you enable a browser extension designed to block tracking, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Badger">Privacy Badger</a>, non-essential cookies set by a website or third parties may be disabled.</li>
      <li>If you enable a browser extension designed to block unwanted content, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin">uBlock Origin</a>, non-essential cookies will be disabled to the extent that content that sets non-essential cookies will be blocked.</li>
      <li>You may use the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to communicate your privacy preferences. If MZLA detects the GPC signal from your device, MZLA will not share your data (we do not sell your data). To learn more, visit <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control — Take Control Of Your Privacy</a></li>
    </ul>


    <p>These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our Services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.</p>

    <h2>US State Specific Information</h2>

    <p>This section provides extra information specifically for residents of certain US states that have distinct data privacy laws and regulations. These laws may grant specific rights to residents of these states when the laws come into effect. This section uses the term “personal information” as an equivalent to the term “Personal Data.”</p>

    <h3>Privacy Rights</h3>

    <p>These rights are common to the US State privacy laws:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Right to Knowledge and Correction:</strong> You have the right to request details on the specific personal information we’ve collected about you and the right to correct inaccurate information.

      <li><strong>Right to Know Data Recipients:</strong> We share your information with service providers for legitimate business operations, such as data storage and hosting. For more details, please see “Sharing Your Information” below.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to request Deletion:</strong> You reserve the right to request the deletion of your data, barring a few exceptions. Such exceptions include circumstances where we are required to retain data to comply with legal obligations, detect fraudulent activity, investigate reports of abuse or other violations of our Terms of Service, or rectify security issues. Upon receiving your verified request, we will promptly delete your personal information (unless an exception applies), and instruct our service providers to do the same. We employ brief retention terms by design.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to a Timely Response:</strong> You are allowed to make two free requests in any 12-month period. We commit to responding to your request within 45 days. In complex cases, we may extend our response time by an additional 45 days.</li>
