    <p>
      Share large files with end-to-end encryption and fewer limits. Send provides a natural file attachment experience in Thunderbird Desktop and is compatible with any recipient’s inbox. Know your attachments will arrive safe and secure.

          Your files are protected from the moment they leave your device until they reach their destination. With encryption both in transit and at rest,  plus optional password protection, sensitive documents stay private, so even we can't see what you're sharing.
