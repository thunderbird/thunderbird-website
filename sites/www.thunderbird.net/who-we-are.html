      <h1>Meet <span class="txt-gradient">Thunderbird</span></h1>
      <p>Thunderbird is a Mozilla-backed community project creating free and open-source software to make organizing and emailing easier. It is available because of the contributions of thousands of individuals and organizations since 2003. Email remains among the most accessible and universal ways for people to communicate across the world, but how and where people use email is changing. Thunderbird is changing, too. Learn what values, community, and organization guide that change and ensure you remain connected, productive, and free.</p>
