      {% trans trimmed %}
        We do not collect any additional fees or taxes. When you donate in your local currency you are not charged a
        conversion fee by your credit card. You can choose to also cover the payment processing transaction costs.
        This is completely voluntary and you may opt in or out using the checkbox on our donation form. Our organization
        is based in the United States. We encourage donors to research any additional external taxes or fees that may be
        applied by regulators such as your bank or tax authority.

    </summary>
    <p class="answer">
      {% trans trimmed %}
        When you opt to cover our payment transaction costs, you're covering both our payment processing and donation platform fees. The
        costs associated with our robust online donation system allows us to continue scaling sustainably as our
        supporter-base grows. Our donation platform and payment processor partners reduce internal costs associated with
        maintaining our own system from scratch. Our partners ensure we can accept a wide range of currencies/payment
        methods and remain PCI compliant in all of the countries that we accept gifts from. The transaction costs you
        may choose to cover are based on an estimate of our overall costs. Due to many factors actual costs may fluctuate.

    </summary>
    <p class="answer">
      {% trans trimmed %}
        When making a one-time gift through SEPA direct debit, you may notice a mention of recurrent transactions. This is because our payment processor Stripe only supports recurring transactions for this type of payment. Regardless of this, we will only charge you once and we will not make any further payments on your account without your authorization. Following the mandate, you will receive an official donation receipt that will clearly reflect the one-time donation.
