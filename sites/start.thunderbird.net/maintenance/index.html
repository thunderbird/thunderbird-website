    File copy from the Firefox Add-ons site is taking significantly longer than expected. Due to this, we've further extended maintenance until at least July 13,
    and potentially Monday.<br><br>
    The site will return by <span style="font-weight: bold;">July 16 21:00 UTC at the latest.</span></p>
