# Archived Media

Pre-redesign pages were rendered in full, and then copied as-is to their proper destination. Their paths were also adjusted to pull from media/archived. This reduces the amount of legacy build styles we have to maintain. 

New metropolis/Inter fonts are not currently archived as they're used on the current design. This will need to be adjusted if we change fonts.

Assets folder hasn't been touched.
