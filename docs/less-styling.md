# Thunderbird.net Style
Some notes on less styling on Thunderbird.net.

As of the new design (2024) we use `base-style.less`. 

The intention is to allow us to move away from the tailwind-esque system built for the previous design to help with readability. 

The new base and component styles can be found in `new/`. While individual page style tweaks can be found under `pages/`.

The other directories are currently preserved to ensure appeal (and start) pages don't break, but will hopefully be removed in the future.
